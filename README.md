Original Addon is: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=611873052 (_TTT Mirror Fate_)          
my version of it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=899488990 (_TTT Mirror Fate (nerfed)_)

I nerfed it because my mates said that it is too op.

- [damage to your killer] = 1.23 * [the time after your dead]
- You can choose the time between 20 and 90 seconds.

So, if you are good in math you know that it won't kill your killer but if he got any hit before he will probably die.
